# ☕ Coffee Sales Analysis – CrewAI Multi-Agent System

## 1. Project Overview

This project implements an **agent-based machine learning pipeline** using
**CrewAI**, where multiple autonomous agents collaborate to analyze coffee
vending machine sales data, engineer features, train predictive models,
and generate actionable business insights.

The system demonstrates how **AI agents can replace manual data science
workflows** with a structured, automated, and explainable pipeline.

---

## 2. Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of transaction-level coffee sales records collected from
a real vending machine.

### Data Collection Period
- Start: March 2024
- End: Present (continuously updated)

### Dataset Size
- Records processed: 3,636
- Engineered features: 19

## 3. Agent-Based Architecture (CrewAI)

The core of the project is a **CrewAI-powered multi-agent system**.

### Agent Roles

**1. Data Analyst Agent**
- Loads and validates raw sales data
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Detects temporal patterns and anomalies

**2. Feature Engineering Agent**
- Generates time-based features (hour, bins, non-linear terms)
- Encodes weekday and seasonal effects
- Validates feature relevance

**3. Modeling Agent**
- Trains regression models for sales prediction
- Evaluates performance using R², RMSE, MAE, and MSE
- Selects the best-performing model

**4. Insight & Strategy Agent**
- Interprets model outputs and feature importance
- Translates predictions into business insights
- Produces operational recommendations

Agents operate **sequentially and collaboratively**, passing structured
outputs between stages without human intervention.

---

## 4. Feature Engineering (Agent-Driven)

Time-based features were automatically created and validated by the
Feature Engineering Agent.

Key feature groups:
- Hour of day
- Binned hour segments
- Non-linear hour transformations
- Weekday indicators
- Seasonal indicators

Time-related features contributed **78.22%** of total model importance.

---

## 5. Model Performance

The Modeling Agent achieved exceptional predictive accuracy:

- R² Score: 0.9989 (99.89%)
- RMSE: 0.0760
- MAE: 0.0426
- MSE: 0.0058

This confirms that the agent-based pipeline produces **highly reliable
and production-grade results**.

## 6. Insights Generated by Agents

### Peak Consumption Detection
- Morning: 10–11 AM
- Afternoon: ~4 PM
- Late evening: ~10 PM

### Weekly & Seasonal Patterns
- Mid-week demand exceeds weekends
- Spring and Fall show highest sales
- Summer months are quieter

### Product Preference Analysis
- 72% of sales are milk-based beverages
- Americano with Milk and Latte account for 44.2% of all transactions

---

## 7. Business Recommendations (Agent-Generated)

- Increase staffing and inventory during peak hours
- Focus inventory on milk-based beverages
- Reduce supply during low-demand summer months
- Extend service hours to capture late-evening demand

All recommendations are **derived autonomously by AI agents** based on
model outputs and statistical evidence.

## 8. Use Cases

- Demonstration of CrewAI in real-world data science
- Autonomous analytics pipelines
- AI-assisted decision support systems
- Demand forecasting automation
